# SpendCtrl Success Metrics & Critical Thresholds

## Critical Success Factors

### **Marqeta Partnership**
Your success depends heavily on Marqeta's APIs - maintain good vendor relationships and understand their pricing model

### **Compliance First**
Financial services are heavily regulated - budget for legal/compliance costs from day one

### **Real-Time Performance**
JIT funding decisions must be sub-100ms to avoid transaction declines

## Technical Priorities

### **Start Simple**
Begin with virtual cards in sandbox before physical cards

### **Webhook Reliability**
Build robust retry mechanisms - failed webhooks = lost transactions

### **Security by Design**
Implement security controls from MVP, not as an afterthought

## Business Considerations

### **Usage-Based Costs**
Marqeta pricing scales with transaction volume - model this carefully

### **Pilot Strategy**
Start with 50-100 internal users before external customers

### **Competitive Moat**
Focus on unique spending controls and user experience - the card issuance itself is commoditized

## Risk Management

### **Vendor Lock-in**
Marqeta integration is deep - have contingency plans

### **Regulatory Changes**
Financial regulations evolve - stay informed

### **Fraud Prevention**
Build robust fraud detection from the start

### Month 4 (Launch Month)
- 🎯 **Minimum Viable**: 25 active users
- 🚀 **Target**: 50 active users

- ⚠️ **Critical**: Below 25 users = Marqeta may question viability

### Month 6 (End of Pilot)
- 🎯 **Survival Threshold**: 150 active users
- 🚀 **Growth Target**: 300 active users
- 💰 **Transaction Volume**: $75K monthly
- ⚠️ **Critical**: Below 150 users = Risk of Marqeta contract renegotiation
