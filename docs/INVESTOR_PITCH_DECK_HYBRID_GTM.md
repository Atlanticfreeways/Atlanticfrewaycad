Executive Summary

Positioning: Card Issuance API Platform for Fintech Startups

Atlantic Freeway Card enables fintech startups to launch card programs in 1 week instead of 6 months. We provide B2B API infrastructure with a consumer platform that showcases capabilities and generates transaction data.

Market Opportunity:
- 10,000+ fintech startups need card infrastructure
- Marqeta charges $50K setup + $10K/mo (enterprise only)
- We charge $500 setup + $500/mo (startup-friendly)
- Built-in consumer platform proves market demand

Current Traction:
- Platform 70% complete (13,306 lines of code)
- 3 pilot customers committed
- Marqeta partnership secured
- 25 waitlist signups

Funding Need: $15K-50K for 8-12 months runway to reach $18K-51K MRR


Problem: Fintech Startups Waste 6 Months Building Cards

Current Options Are Inadequate

Build In-House:
- Timeline: 6-12 months

Marqeta (Enterprise Focus):
- Setup: $50,000
- Monthly minimum: $10,000
- Target: Fortune 500 only
- Result: Prohibitively expensive for startups

Stripe Issuing:
- Geography: US-only
- Customization: Limited
- Crypto: Not supported
- Result: Doesn't serve global or crypto-focused startups

Market Gap: No affordable, global, developer-friendly card infrastructure exists for early-stage fintech companies.
