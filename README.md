## 🎯 Platform Overview

Atlanticfrewaycard has evolved into a robust, scalable platform leveraging modern infrastructure:
- **Business Module**: Corporate expense management (SpendCtrl)
- **Personal Module**: Individual virtual cards with crypto funding (Freeway Cards)
- **JIT Funding Engine**: Real-time authorization processing (Go Microservice)

## 🏗️ Architecture V2

The system now follows a hybrid microservices architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[Web/Mobile Clients] --> LB[Nginx Load Balancer]
    LB --> NodeAPI[Node.js Monolith API]
    LB --> GoService[Go JIT Service]
    
    NodeAPI --> PG[(PostgreSQL)]
    NodeAPI --> Mongo[(MongoDB)]
    NodeAPI --> Redis[(Redis Cache)]
    
    NodeAPI --"Events"--> RabbitMQ{RabbitMQ}
    RabbitMQ --> GoService
    
    GoService --> Redis
    GoService --> PG
    GoService --> Marqeta[Marqeta API]
```

### Components
1.  **Core API (Node.js)**: Handles business logic, user management, and dashboards.
2.  **JIT Funding Service (Go)**: High-performance microservice for processing card authorizations in <100ms.
3.  **Message Broker (RabbitMQ)**: Decouples transaction processing from user-facing APIs.
4.  **Security**: PCI-compliant encryption (AES-256) and tiered caching.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ (for local dev)
- Go 1.21+ (for service dev)

### 🐳 Docker Deployment (Recommended)
The entire platform (App, Go Service, DBs) can be launched with a single command:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>

# 2. Setup Env
cp .env.required .env
# (Edit .env with your keys)

# 3. Launch
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Access the services:
- **Web App**: `http://localhost:80`
- **Business Dashboard**: `http://localhost:80/business`
- **JIT Service Health**: `http://localhost:8080/health`

### 🔧 Local Development

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**JIT Service (Go):**
```bash
cd jit-funding-service
go run main.go
```

## 🔧 Development Status

### ✅ Phase 1-5 (V1) Completed
- Foundation, Core Services, Security, Compliance, and Basic Frontend.

### ✅ Roadmap V2 Completed
- [x] **Event-Driven Architecture**: RabbitMQ implementation for decoupled transactions.
- [x] **JIT Funding Microservice**: High-concurrency Go service for zero-latency authorizations.
- [x] **Advanced Monitoring**: Sentry, Prometheus, and ELK integration.
- [x] **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose & Kubernetes manifests (`k8s/`).
- [x] **Dashboards**: Next.js Business and Personal dashboards.
